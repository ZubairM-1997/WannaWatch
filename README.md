WannaWatch is an app developed in Ruby, designed to allow users to track movies that they want to watch (get it?).  Using TheMovieDB's API, we allow users to choose from historical flicks, current blockbusters, or upcoming releases, and keep track of when they're going to hit theaters.  WannaWatchers can view leaderboards for users with the longest watch list, see the most watched movies, and browse through movies by title, series, or genre.  We've preloaded a number of movies into our database, but the app includes the ability to search using TMDB's API and find additional titles.

To get started:
1) Create a new username and password
2) Add a few Wannawatches (try adding one of your favorites, and then using our 'Browse other movies like this' feature!)
3) The next time you're looking for inspiration, refer to your WannaWatch list
4) Remove the watch each time you finish watching one!

Check out our leaderboards to see what movies are popular and who our heaviest users are.

Happy watching!
